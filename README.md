The scope of the analysis includes:
1. Exploration of customer demographics
2. Identify the on-demand iPhone11 features
3. Sentiment analysis of the tweets to capture the customer response on various iPhone 11 features
4. Evaluate the iPhone11 performance in comparison to the recent phones of other brands like Samsung and Google

During the project, we analyzed the data corresponding to 12000 tweets, which included features related to the tweets, retweets, user demographics, location, and the number of followers to a user to understand the impact that each tweet on its followers.

This objective is achieved through accomplishing the below tasks:
  •	Web scrapping the customer review tweets on iPhone11, iPhone11Pro and iPhone11Pro Max from the data from twitter handles through API       provided by Twitter
  •	Clean the text data obtained from web scraping and format it accordingly
  •	Analyze the final data obtained in the above step and Generate visualization graphs to explain the patterns in customer feedback           through R/Python packages.
